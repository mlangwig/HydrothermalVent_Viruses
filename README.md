# Background

An analysis of viruses identified from 52 globally distributed hydrothermal vents (10 hydrothermal plumes and 42 vent deposits), collected from 2004 to 2018. These data were previously reconstructed and analysed in the context of microbial diversity in [hydrothermal vent deposits](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-022-01424-7) and [hydrothermal plumes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-023-01421-0).
