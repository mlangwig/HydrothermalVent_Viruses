# Background

An analysis of viruses identified in 42 metagenomes from 4 deep-sea hydrothermal vent fields and a deep-sea volcano collected from 2004 to 2018. These data were previously reconstructed and analysed in the context of microbial diversity in a [previous publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.08.503129v1).
