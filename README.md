# Hydrothermal Vent Viruses

This code was used to complete an analysis of viruses identified from 52 globally distributed hydrothermal vents (10 hydrothermal plumes, 40 vent deposits, and 2 diffuse flow), collected from 2004 to 2018. These data were previously reconstructed and analysed in the context of microbial diversity in [hydrothermal vent deposits](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-022-01424-7) and [hydrothermal plumes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-023-01421-0). 

The work is published as a [journal article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59154-x) in Nature Communications.

## Genome Information
