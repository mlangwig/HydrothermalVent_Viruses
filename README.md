# Hydrothermal Vent Viruses

An analysis of viruses identified from 52 globally distributed hydrothermal vents (10 hydrothermal plumes, 40 vent deposits, and 2 diffuse flow), collected from 2004 to 2018. These data were previously reconstructed and analysed in the context of microbial diversity in [hydrothermal vent deposits](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-022-01424-7) and [hydrothermal plumes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-023-01421-0). 

The paper is currently available as [a preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.12.603268v1.full.pdf+html).

## Genome Information

The viral genomes are publicly available on [Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Hydrothermal_Vent_Viruses/25968037).
